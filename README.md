# Signal-and-Image-Processing

## All techniques implemented
1. Erosion: Removes pixels at object edges, useful for thinning object boundaries.
2. Dilation: Adds pixels at object edges, helpful for filling gaps or thickening object boundaries.
3. Opening: Erosion followed by dilation, removes small objects or noise while preserving larger object shapes.
4. Closing: Dilation followed by erosion, fills small gaps or connects objects separated by narrow spaces.
5. Thinning: Reduces object thickness while maintaining topology, suitable for extracting object centerlines.
6. Thickening: Increases object thickness, useful for noise robustness or connecting nearby objects.
7. Hole Filling: Using dilation and erosion in sequence to fill gaps or holes within objects.
8. Boundary Extraction: Identifies and extracts object boundaries, essential for isolating regions or detecting changes in images.
